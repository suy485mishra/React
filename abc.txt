 It is primarily used as a plugin or extension for text editors and integrated 
 development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and others. 

 2) Difference between a Library and Framework?
Ans: libraries provide specific tools or functions that you can use in your code,
 offering flexibility and control over the structure of your application.
  Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a structured foundation and enforce a specific architectural pattern,
 often requiring you to follow their conventions and guidelines

3) What is CDN? Why do we use it?
Ans:A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work
 together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. 
The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.

4)Why is React known as React?
Ans:The name "React" was chosen because it emphasizes the library's primary purpose, 
which is to react to changes in data and efficiently update the user interface (UI) to reflect those changes.

5) What is crossorigin in script tag?
Ans:The crossorigin attribute in a <script> tag is used to specify how a web browser should handle cross-origin requests when loading
 external scripts. 
Cross-origin requests occur when a web page hosted on one domain (origin) attempts to load a script from a different domain (origin).
 Due to security restrictions in web browsers, such requests are subject to certain policies,and the 
 crossorigin attribute helps control how these policies are enforced.

6) What is diference between React and ReactDOM
Ans:React is the core library that allows you to create and manage React components, and it provides the foundation for building user interfaces in React applications. 
ReactDOM, on the other hand, is a companion library used for the specific purpose of rendering React components into the actual DOM in web applications.

7)What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans: Development is the stage of an application before it's made public while production is the term used for the same application when it's made public.
 Development build is several times (maybe 3-5x) slower than the production build.

 8)What is async and defer
 Ans:When you include a <script> tag with the async attribute, it tells the browser to continue parsing the
  HTML document while simultaneously downloading the external JavaScript file in the background.
  When you include a <script> tag with the defer attribute, it also tells the browser to download the external JavaScript file 
  in the background, 
  but it defers the execution of the script until after the HTML document has been parsed.
